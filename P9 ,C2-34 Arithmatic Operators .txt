    float c ;
    a=5;
    b=2;
    c=a+b;
    printf("sum of %d and %d is %.2f\n", a,b,c);
    c=a*b;
    printf("Product of %d and %d is %.2f\n",a,b,c);
    c=a/b;

}

Outputsum of 5 and 2 is 7.00
Product of 5 and 2 is 10.00
Integer division of 5 by 2 is 2.00
Real division of 5 by 2 is2.50
